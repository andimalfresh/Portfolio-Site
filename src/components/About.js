                Hello my name is Andrew Pedersen. I am a Software Engineer fluent in both front-end and back-end development. From a young age I have been enthralled in technology, I began learning front end development in the late 90's and kept it up as a hobby over the years along with graphic design. In early 2018, I decided to make a pivot in my career and focus soley on Software Engineering. I am currently enrolled in Galvanize's Full Stack Immersive Web Development Program which is over 800 hours of front and back end application development.
